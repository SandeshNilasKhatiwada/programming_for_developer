/*
Approach: The question asks us to find the impacted devices connected to the device experiencing power failure.
First an adjacent matrix is created called network and populated with the connections between different devices.
Then the devices that are directly connected to the target device are found.
On doing so, depth first search is applied for each connected device, while checking if they are connected to source in any way.
If a connected device does not lead to the source, all the devices involved in the dfs, including that connected device are added to the list of impacted devices
The devices connected directly or indirectly to the source are also extracted using a helper function and used in the DFS function
